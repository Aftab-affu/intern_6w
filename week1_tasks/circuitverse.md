This is the view of circuitverse interface 




Step 2:
       After signing up you have to click launch simulator then this interface will come up on your desktop

Step 3:
       you can make complex circuits using simple circuits by inserting sub-circuits

This is the view of complex circuit by inserting above sub-circuits andd by clicking export verilog we get code for the build circuit

This is the view of verilog code given by circuitverse simulator

After taking this verilog code we can go to EDA playground and run it . For all the above reasons circuit verse is best online simulator for beginners and everyone.
